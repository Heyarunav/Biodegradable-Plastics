    <h1>Biodegradable Plastics and Sustainable Biomanufacturing</h1>
    <p><strong>Author: Deepshikha Barman, 2nd Sem</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine a world where plastic packaging decomposes naturally, reducing waste and pollution. 
        Biodegradable plastics and sustainable biomanufacturing are making this vision a reality by 
        transforming waste into useful products and reducing our dependence on traditional, non-degradable materials.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Nature’s Cycle</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike conventional plastics, which persist for centuries, biodegradable alternatives break down 
        naturally. Scientists use organic sources like plant starches, seaweed, and bacteria that 
        consume methane to produce eco-friendly materials like *PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoates)* and *PLA (Polylactic Acid)*.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Biodegradable Plastics</h2>

    <h3>1. Medical Innovations</h3>
    <p>
        Biodegradable plastics are being used to create dissolvable stitches, drug capsules, and 
        temporary implants, reducing medical waste and improving patient safety.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Packaging and Consumer Goods</h3>
    <p>
        Eco-friendly alternatives to traditional plastic packaging are already in use for food wrappers, 
        shopping bags, and disposable cutlery. Some major companies are shifting toward these materials 
        to minimize their environmental impact.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Industrial and Agricultural Use</h3>
    <p>
        Agricultural films made from biodegradable plastics help improve soil conditions while reducing 
        plastic waste. Industrial components, such as bioplastic automotive parts, are also gaining traction.
    </p>

    <h2>Advances in Sustainable Biomanufacturing</h2>
    <p>
        Researchers are using *microbes and AI-driven processes* to convert agricultural waste into bioplastics. 
        Additionally, CO₂ emissions are being captured and turned into useful materials, minimizing carbon footprints.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>
        While biodegradable plastics are a major step forward, challenges like production costs and 
        waste management infrastructure must be addressed. The *Global Plastic Treaty* aims to enforce 
        strict sustainability policies, pushing industries to adopt eco-friendly materials.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Biodegradable plastics and biomanufacturing represent more than alternatives; they form 
        the foundation of a *circular economy*. By turning waste into resources and pollution into solutions, 
        they provide a roadmap for achieving a balance between development and environmental preservation. 
        The urgency is clear: transitioning from traditional plastics to sustainable systems is not just feasible—it’s essential.
